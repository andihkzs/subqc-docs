# 🤖 AI-Generated Checklist

SubQC-AI offers an AI-assisted way to create checklists, saving you time and increasing inspection accuracy.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Select a product from the list.
2. Click **Generate Checklist using AI**.
3. The system reads:
   - Product Description
   - Technical Specs
4. It then builds:
   - Inspection Instructions
   - Matching Response Fields

---

## ✨ Benefits

- Saves manual effort
- Generates inspection-specific tasks
- Customizable after generation

You can still manually edit any field after the AI creates it.

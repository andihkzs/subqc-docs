# 🔍 Types of Checklists

SubQC-AI supports two types of checklists:

---

## ✅ AQL Checklists

- Used with AQL Work Orders
- Include predefined fields like:
  - Person Name
  - Measurement
  - Media Uploads
  - Annotations
  - Signatures

---

## 📝 Non-AQL Checklists

- More flexible
- Include additional fields like:
  - Response Sets (e.g. Good → Poor)
  - Custom feedback
  - Rating sliders

Each checklist type tailors the inspection process based on the product and quality control needs.

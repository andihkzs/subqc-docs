# 🔍 Inspections & Reports

Inspections are conducted by inspectors using the SubQC-AI mobile app.  
Each inspection is tied to a **Work Order** and uses a specific **Checklist** to ensure product quality.

Once completed, the system generates a **Report**, which can be shared, commented on, and downloaded.

## 🔁 Inspection-to-Report Workflow

1. **Inspector starts an inspection** from the assigned work order
2. **Checklist responses and defects** are submitted via the app
3. A **report** is automatically generated with all results
4. The report can then be **shared**, **commented on**, and **exported as PDF**

# 📄 Work Orders

In SubQC-AI, a **Work Order** is a request for product inspection. It can be created by Company Admins, Employees, or Super-Admins to ensure product quality through thorough inspections by assigned inspectors.

Work Orders are the foundation of the inspection process — they link together your **products**, **checklists**, and **inspectors** into a single workflow.

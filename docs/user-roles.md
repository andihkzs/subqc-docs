# ðŸ‘¥ User Roles & Permissions

SubQC-AI has a role-based access model. Each user has permissions tailored to their responsibilities. This ensures clear separation of access and better security.

## ðŸ”‘ Role Overview

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Company Admin** | Full access to products, suppliers, work orders, checklists, reports, users |
| **Company Employee** | Add/view products, suppliers, checklists, work orders, and reports |
| **Company Inspector** | Use mobile app to inspect products, view assigned work orders and reports |

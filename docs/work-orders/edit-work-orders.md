# ✏️ Edit Work Orders

Editing a work order allows you to update its details before the inspection process begins.

---

## 🔐 Edit Permissions

You can **only edit** a work order **before it is in progress**. Once an inspector begins working on it, editing is disabled to maintain data integrity.

---

## 🛠️ How to Edit a Work Order

1. Go to the **Work Order** tab.
2. Locate the work order you want to modify.
3. Click the **Edit** icon (✏️) next to the work order entry.
4. Modify the necessary fields:
   - Dates
   - Quantity
   - Assigned Inspector
   - Checklist/Product
5. Click **Save Changes**.

## ❗ Important

If a work order is **in progress** or **completed**, editing will be locked. To make changes, you must cancel and recreate the work order.

# ➕ Add a Work Order

To initiate a product inspection, you need to create a **Work Order**. SubQC-AI allows you to create either a **Standard Work Order** or an **AQL Work Order**, depending on your inspection needs.

## 🛠️ Steps to Add a Work Order

1. Navigate to the **Work Order** tab in the sidebar.
2. Choose between:
   - 📦 **Standard Work Order**
   - 📏 **AQL Work Order**
3. Click **Add Work Order**.
4. Fill in the required form fields:

### 📋 Form Fields

- **Order No.**
- **Inspection Date**
- **Expected Shipment Date**
- **Service Request**
- **Allow Factory to Change Date**
- **Order Quantity** & **Unit**
- **Product** (select from product list)
- **Checklist** (select from checklist library)
- **Inspector** (assign one)

If you're creating an **AQL Work Order**, the form will also include:

- ✅ **AQL Calculator**
- 🚚 **Shipment Details**

## 📎 Notes

- Only one inspector can be assigned to a work order.
- Make sure the selected product and checklist are already created beforehand.
- The "Allow Factory to Change Date" toggle enables flexibility if scheduling is uncertain.
